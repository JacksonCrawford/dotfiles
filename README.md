My personal AwesomeWM Config

![desktop](screenshots/desktop.png)

This is my pretty simple Awesome setup, very minimal as far as features but I have all the essential stuff in the top bar. Rofi is used as the launcher (with a matching colorscheme), though there are hotkeys for most frequently used programs. Kitty is the default terminal and a config with a matching colorscheme is included in the dots. My neovim config has some options tweaked and uses the [Quantum](https://github.com/tyrannicaltoucan/vim-quantum) vim ariline and colorscheme.

This was originally adapted from [Awesome Copycats](https://github.com/lcpz/awesome-copycats).


## Dependencies

- light

- rofi

- redshift


## Fonts

I use [Icomoon](https://icomoon.io/) for the top bar icons and the taglist (workspaces list/desktop list/whatever!) circles. Then [Futura](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/futura-pt) is set in theme.lua to be a general system font.
