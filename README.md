My personal AwesomeWM Config (with rofi included)

This is my pretty simple Awesome setup, very minimal as far as features but I have all the essential stuff in the top bar.

I went with the nord cholorscheme, and have found that any blueish wallpaper looks nice with it!

This is done with the stable branch of Awesome. I have only tested it on Fedora, but it should work on every distro that Awesome is available for!
