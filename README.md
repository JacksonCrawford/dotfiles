This is my AwesomeWM setup running on the stable branch. The whole desktop is built to be minimal, with a pop-up dashboard containing all the time and system information, along with a hub for hotkeys.


Rofi is used as the launcher (with a matching colorscheme), though there are hotkeys for most frequently used programs. Kitty is the default terminal and a config with a matching colorscheme is included in the dots. My neovim config has some options tweaked and uses the [Quantum](https://github.com/tyrannicaltoucan/vim-quantum) vim airine and colorscheme.


There are light and dark colorschemes.


This widgets are originally adapted from [Awesome Copycats](https://github.com/lcpz/awesome-copycats).
